# 🎵 What Makes a Song a Hit? — Spotify Hit Prediction Using Machine Learning

**Aug 2025 – Sep 2025**  
**Author:** *Oskar Diyali and Logan Smith*

This project analyzes what makes a song a **hit** by exploring **80,000+ Spotify tracks** using audio features, metadata, and lyrics. I built a full machine learning pipeline—from data cleaning to model evaluation—achieving **AUC > 0.86** and uncovering key traits such as a strong tempo cluster around **110–130 BPM**.

## 1. Project Overview

### Goal  
Predict whether a song becomes a “hit” using:

- Spotify audio features  
- Artist metadata  
- Billboard chart performance  
- Lyrics (TF–IDF transformed)

A track is labeled a **hit** if its Spotify popularity score is **≥ 45**.

### Why This Project Matters  
This project blends **music**, **data science**, and **machine learning**, turning subjective “hit intuition” into quantifiable patterns.

## 🔍 6. Key Findings

### 1. Tempo matters  
A strong hit cluster appears around **110–130 BPM**, especially near 120 BPM.

### 2. Danceability & loudness predict hits  
High-energy, louder songs are more likely to chart.

### 3. Metadata is extremely predictive  
Artist popularity and follower count significantly improve model performance.

### 4. Lyrics add interpretability  
TF–IDF reveals common emotional and thematic words in hit songs.
